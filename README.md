# physics-sim
modelling projectile motion via pygame and basic kinematic equations 

### Dependencies: 
``pygame``

### How it works:
The ball is given attributes via the user in the temrinal, these attributes relate to the trajectory of the ball which is simulated or rather modelled.  
To start the sim, press space after entering in the values.

### Kinematic Equations used:
``S = D/t`` {S= speed, D= distance, t= time}  
``s = u*t + (a*t^2)/2`` {S= displacement, u= initial velocity, a= acceleration, t= time}

### Mathematics used: 
radians to degree measures
