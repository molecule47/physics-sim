# physics-sim

Modelling and simulating physics via python and pygame.

### Dependencies:

`pygame`

### Particle Physics

Simulating physics of particles using forces which constitute or affect said particles.

#### How it works:

under dev 

#### Equations used:

under dev


### Projectile Motion

Form of motion of an object in a gravitational field.

#### How it works:

The ball is given attributes via the user in the terminal, these attributes relate to the trajectory of the ball which is simulated or rather modelled. To start, press space after entering in the values, the simulation is relative to every 0.2 second instead of 1, this makes it easier to see.

#### Equations used:

Relation between distance, speed, time $$d = {v}\times{t}$$

Displacement formula $$\Delta{x} = u\times t + \frac{a\times t^2}{2}$$

Componenent of velocity along x axis $$u_x = u\times\cos\theta$$

Componenent of velocity along y axis $$u_y = u\times\sin\theta$$

Maximum height of a projectile $$\frac{u^2\times\sin^2\theta}{2g}$$

Horizontal displacement of a projectile $$\frac{u^2\times\sin2\theta}{g}$$

Radian to degree formula $$rad = \theta\times\frac{\pi}{180}$$
